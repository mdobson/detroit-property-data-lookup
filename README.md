# Land Contracts in Detroit

Zillow scraping functionality credit goes to this repo: https://github.com/ChrisMuir/Zillow. Without it I would not be able to jump start this project.

This repo is to be considered a work in progress. This sets up a data processing pipeline that uses data from real estate websites to try
and build a model of the land contract market in the City of Detroit.

Each directory contains the tooling necessary to search for this data.

This repo is a work in progress, and simply creates a csv of all relevant data scraped from potential land contract listings.
